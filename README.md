The data of this visualization was published in july 2018 by the colombian [Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications](https://www.mintic.gov.co) (MinTIC) in the open data web pages www.datos.gov.co

## Objective
To generate an interactive visualization to present and summarize the distribution of MINTIC's free wifi zones in colombian departments and municipalities.

## Used Technologies
* [D3](https://d3js.org/)
* [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com)
* PHP (To preprocess data).

## Local execution
